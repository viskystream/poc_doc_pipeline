LivelyVideo gives the operator full control over the presentation of streams to their user base. In addition to providing options for authentication/authorization and distribution of a source stream to the end user, the platform allows the operator to modify the stream in real time to accommodate various business cases. The most common of these cases is to transrate the stream into multiple different resolutions or framerates, providing the option for low/medium/high qualities to the end user to better accommodate for internet connections that are not able to support viewing the source stream. Additionally, effects such as blurring can be selectively applied to streams to craft custom use cases for enhancing engagement.

Whether you are looking to optimize for various network conditions, modify for a specific business case, or make your livestream stand out with your branding, our customization options allow you to adjust and enhance your stream from its original format.

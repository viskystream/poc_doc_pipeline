## What is Direct Streaming?

Direct Streaming as a viewer is when a viewer/viewers join a private broadcast while simultaneously broadcasting themselves. One of the main uses of Direct Streaming is an individual direct connection that can be established.

## Getting started with Direct Streaming?

The Direct Streaming connection is comprised of four different components that we offer. Two `Encoders`, a `Web Player` and a `Manifest Player`. The application for a Direct Streaming a broadcast is then split into two parts the broadcast owner and the broadcast viewer. The broadcast owner will have one `Encoder` and one `Web Player`, the broadcast viewer will have one `Encoder` and one `Manifest Player`. These documents will cover how to add these components and establish a Direct Streaming broadcast.

## Broadcast Owner

This guide will cover Direct Streaming from the broadcasters side. Please note that in order for this to work you will also need to implement the broadcast viewer section of Direct Streaming.

## Before Getting Started

LivelyVideo's Player API can either be used as a standalone JavaScript API or as a React Component Library.

Project dependencies include knowledge of and experience with:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html)
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), including [Providers](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextprovider)

If you are new to any of the above, we recommend spending some time familiarizing yourself with these before moving on.

ℹ️ **IMPORTANT**: You will also need _your domain_ which will be provided by LivelyVideo.

## Part I: Set up your Encoder component

To start we will add the completed code for the `Encoder`. Please refer to our docs for the `Encoder` if you are confused about any of the code below! If you would like to skip all of the guide and just view the final code please click [here](#full-code)!

Note: This is a much simpler version of our `Encoder` than in our `Encoder` docs, this is done on purpose as we will only need one `VideoClient` for the `Encoder` and `Manifest Player`.

```tsx
import {
  CameraButton,
  ControlBar,
  EncoderUiState,
  EncoderVideo,
  JoinBroadcastButton,
  EncoderUiContext,
  VideoClientContext,
  CallContext,
  CallState,
  MediaContainer,
  MicrophoneButton,
  types,
} from "@video/video-client-web";
import { observer } from "mobx-react-lite";
import React from "react";

const Encoder = ({
  encoderUi = null,
  videoclient,
  setOwnerCall,
  callState,
}: {
  encoderUi: EncoderUiState | null;
  videoclient: types.VideoClient | null;
  setOwnerCall?: (call: types.BaseCall | null) => void;
  callState: CallState | null;
}): React.ReactElement => {
  return (
    <VideoClientContext.Provider value={videoclient}>
      <CallContext.Provider value={callState}>
        <EncoderUiContext.Provider value={encoderUi}>
          <MediaContainer>
            <EncoderVideo />
            <ControlBar variant="encoder">
              {callId !== "" && (
                <JoinBroadcastButton
                  setOwnerCall={setOwnerCall}
                  broadcastOptions={{
                    streamName: "demo",
                  }}
                />
              )}
              <CameraButton />
              <MicrophoneButton />
            </ControlBar>
          </MediaContainer>
        </EncoderUiContext.Provider>
      </CallContext.Provider>
    </VideoClientContext.Provider>
  );
};

export { Encoder };
```

## Part II: Set up your Web Player component

Now that we have our `Encoder` we will want to create a `Web Player` so that our broadcaster can see our viewer when a direct streaming request is made. If you would like to learn more about how our `Web Player` is constructed please view our `Player` docs.

Note: Similar to our `Encoder` this will be a much simpler implementation of our `Web Player`, this is done on purpose.

```ts
import {
  ControlBar,
  MediaContainer,
  PeerMutedBadge,
  PlayerAudioButton,
  PlayerPlayButton,
  PlayerVideo,
} from "@video/video-client-web";
import React, { ReactElement } from "react";
import { VideoWrapper } from "./StyledComponents";

const Player = (): ReactElement => {
  return (
    <VideoWrapper>
      <MediaContainer>
        <PlayerVideo />
        <ControlBar variant="player">
          <PlayerPlayButton />
          <PlayerAudioButton />
          <PeerMutedBadge color="white" activeColor="red" />
        </ControlBar>
      </MediaContainer>
    </VideoWrapper>
  );
};

export default Player;
```

## Part III: Set up your parent component for your Web Player and Encoder

Now that we have our components for both the `Encoder` and `Web Player` we need a parent component that can handle all of the logic necessary for our direct streaming connection.

### Step 1: Set up our parent component and VideoClient

First, we need a `VideoClient` and a parent component to render our `Encoder` and `Player`. Only one `VideoClient` is necessary for both the `Player` and the `Encoder`.

```ts
import {
  EncoderUiState,
  mediaController,
  PlayerUiState,
  types,
  VideoClient,
} from "@video/video-client-web";
import React, { ReactElement, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Encoder } from "./Encoder";
import { Player } from "./Player";

const BroadcastOwner = (): ReactElement => {
  // Here is our Local state that we will use to store different instances that we create.
  const [encoderUi, setEncoderUi] = useState<EncoderUiState | null>(null);
  const [ownerCall, setOwnerCall] = useState<types.BaseCall | null>(null);
  const [vc, setVc] = useState<types.VideoClient | null>(null);

  // useEffect that handles the instantiation of our VideoClient instance
  useEffect(() => {
    // Let's check to ensure our VideoClient is not already created and our endpoint exists before we create our VideoClient
    if (backendEndpoint && vc == null) {
      const vcOptions: types.VideoClientOptions = {
        backendEndpoints: [backendEndpoint],
        //Ensure we are using the scope private broadcaster for our token
        token: tokenRefresher({
          backendEndpoint,
          authUrl: `${backendEndpoint}/apps/demos/api/demo/v1/access-token`,
          streamKey,
          scope: "private-broadcaster",
          clientReferrer,
        }),
      };

      const newVc = new VideoClient(vcOptions);

      setVc(newVc);
    }

    return () => {
      // Ensure we clean up our VideoClient on unmount
      if (vc != null) {
        vc.dispose("Private Broadcaster component unmounting/re-render");
        setVc(null);
      }
    };
  }, [backendEndpoint, vc]);

  // useEffect that handles the instantiation of our encoderUi State.
  useEffect(() => {
    if (encoderUi == null) {
      (async () => {
        // Init our mediaController and then pass that as an option to our new EncoderUiState
        await mediaController.init();
        const mediaStreamController = await mediaController.requestController();
        setEncoderUi(new EncoderUiState(mediaStreamController));
      })();
    }
    return () => {
      // Ensure we are cleaning up the encoder on unmount.
      if (encoderUi != null) {
        encoderUi.dispose("Private Broadcaster component unmounting/re-render");
        setEncoderUi(null);
      }
    };
  }, [encoderUi]);

  return (
    <>
      {encoderUi != null && (
        <Encoder
          setOwnerCall={(call: types.BaseCall | null) => setOwnerCall(call)}
          encoderUi={encoderUi}
          videoclient={vc}
        />
      )}
    </>
  );
};

export default BroadcastOwner;
```

### Step 2: Add our player events to the parent component

Now that we have the base of our parent container for our direct streaming setup we need to add our player events to the `VideoClient`. We will also be rendering out our `Player` here.

Our `playerAdded` event will be triggered when you have begun your owner broadcast and a viewer has requested to begin broadcasting to the call.

Our `playerRemoved` event will be triggered when you already have a player added to your broadcast and they are removed.

```ts
import {
  EncoderUiState,
  mediaController,
  PlayerUiState,
  types,
  VideoClient,
  CallState
} from "@video/video-client-web";
import React, { ReactElement, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { DemoContainer } from "../BasicDemo/StyledComponents";
import { Encoder } from "./Encoder";
import { Player } from "./Player";

const BroadcastOwner = (): ReactElement => {

  //Here is our Local state that we will use to store different instances that we create.
  const [encoderUi, setEncoderUi] = useState<EncoderUiState | null>(null);
  const [playerUi, setPlayerUi] = useState<PlayerUiState | null>(null);
  const [vc, setVc] = useState<types.VideoClient | null>(null);
  const [ownerCall, setOwnerCall] = useState<types.BaseCall | null>(null);
  const [callState, setCallState] = useState<CallState | null>(null);

  // useEffect that handles the instantiation of our VideoClient instance
  useEffect(() => {
    // Let's check to ensure our VideoClient is not already created and our endpoint exists before we create our VideoClient
    if (backendEndpoint && vc == null) {
      const vcOptions: types.VideoClientOptions = {
        backendEndpoints: [backendEndpoint],
        //Ensure we are using the scope private broadcaster for our token
        token:  tokenRefresher({
          backendEndpoint,
          authUrl: `${backendEndpoint}/api/demo/v1/access-token`,
          streamKey,
          scope: "private-broadcaster",
          clientReferrer,
        }),
      };

      const newVc = new VideoClient(vcOptions);
      // This is used to keep track of the current state of our call for the encoder.
      setCallState(new CallState());

      //When a player is added ensure that we are setting this to our new playerUi
      newVc.on("playerAdded", (event) => {
        //Notice that we are auto accepting and adding the player here. This is where you would want to add any accept/reject logic if you do not want it to auto accept.
        const newPlayer = new PlayerUiState(event.player);
        setPlayerUi(newPlayer);
      });

      //When a player is removed ensure we are cleaning up
      newVc.on("playerRemoved", () => {
        if (playerUi != null) {
          playerUi.dispose();
          setPlayerUi(null);
        }
      });

      setVc(newVc);
    }

    return () => {
    // Ensure we clean up our VideoClient on unmount
      if (vc != null && playerUi != null) {
        vc.removeAllListeners("playerAdded");
        vc.removeAllListeners("playerRemoved");
        vc.dispose("Private Broadcaster component unmounting/re-render");
        playerUi.dispose();
        setPlayerUi(null);
        setVc(null);
      }
    };
  }, [backendEndpoint, vc]);

  // useEffect that handles the instantiation of our encoderUi State.
  useEffect(() => {
    if (encoderUi == null) {
      (async () => {
        // Init our mediaController and then pass that as an option to our new EncoderUiState
        await mediaController.init();
        const mediaStreamController = await mediaController.requestController();
        setEncoderUi(new EncoderUiState(mediaStreamController));
      })();
    }
    return () => {
    // Ensure we are cleaning up the encoder on unmount.
      if (encoderUi != null) {
        encoderUi.dispose("Private Broadcaster component unmounting/re-render");
        setEncoderUi(null);
      }
    };
  }, [encoderUi]);

  return (
    <>
      {encoderUi != null && (
        <Encoder
          setOwnerCall={(call: types.BaseCall | null) => setOwnerCall(call)}
          encoderUi={encoderUi}
          videoclient={vc}
          callState={callState}
        />
      )}
        {playerUi != null ? (
          <Player playerUi={playerUi} />
        )}
    </>
  );
};

export default BroadcastOwner;
```

### Step 3: Add a button to kick the viewer

Finally we will add a kick button so that the owner of the broadcast can kick the viewer. For this we will need two things the `ownerCall` and the `userId` for the peer.

`ownerCall` can be obtained by passing a method to our Encoder below which will be passed to the `JoinBroadcastButton`.

Peer `userId` can be obtained from the peer argument passed in the `playerAdded` event.

```ts
import {
  EncoderUiState,
  mediaController,
  PlayerUiState,
  types,
  VideoClient,
  CallState
} from "@video/video-client-web";
import React, { ReactElement, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { DemoContainer } from "../BasicDemo/StyledComponents";
import { Encoder } from "./Encoder";
import { Player } from "./Player";

const BroadcastOwner = (): ReactElement => {

  //Here is our Local state that we will use to store different instances that we create.
  const [encoderUi, setEncoderUi] = useState<EncoderUiState | null>(null);
  const [playerUi, setPlayerUi] = useState<PlayerUiState | null>(null);
  const [vc, setVc] = useState<types.VideoClient | null>(null);
  const [ownerCall, setOwnerCall] = useState<types.BaseCall | null>(null);
  const [callState, setCallState] = useState<CallState | null>(null);
  const [peer, setPeer] = useState<types.BasePeer | null>(null);

  // useEffect that handles the instantiation of our VideoClient instance
  useEffect(() => {
    // Let's check to ensure our VideoClient is not already created and our endpoint exists before we create our VideoClient
    if (backendEndpoint && vc == null) {
      const vcOptions: types.VideoClientOptions = {
        backendEndpoints: [backendEndpoint],
        //Ensure we are using the scope private broadcaster for our token
        token:  tokenRefresher({
          backendEndpoint,
          authUrl: `${backendEndpoint}/api/demo/v1/access-token`,
          streamKey,
          scope: "private-broadcaster",
          clientReferrer,
        }),
      };

      const newVc = new VideoClient(vcOptions);
      // This is used to keep track of the current state of our call for the encoder.
      setCallState(new CallState());

      // When a player is added ensure that we are setting this to our new playerUi
      newVc.on("playerAdded", (event) => {
        // Notice that we are auto accepting and adding the player here. This is where you would want to add any accept/reject logic if you do not want it to auto accept.
        const newPlayer = new PlayerUiState(event.player);
        setPlayerUi(newPlayer);
        // Here we are now setting our peer to local state.
        setPeer(event.peer);
      });

      //When a player is removed ensure we are cleaning up
      newVc.on("playerRemoved", () => {
        if (playerUi != null) {
          playerUi.dispose();
          setPlayerUi(null);
        }
      });

      setVc(newVc);
    }

    // Don't forget to clean up and remove the viewer from the call if the broadcast/call ends!
    useEffect(() => {
      if (callId == null && playerUi) {
        if (peer) {
          ownerCall.kickViewer(peer.userId, true, false);
        }
        playerUi.dispose();
        setPlayerUi(null);
        setPeer(null);
      }
    }, [callId, playerUi, peer, ownerCall]);

    const kickPeer = (): void => {
      if (peer) {
        ownerCall.kickViewer(peer.userId, true, false);
        setPeer(null);
      }
      if(playerUi){
        playerUi.dispose();
        setPlayerUi(null);
      }

    };

    return () => {
    // Ensure we clean up our VideoClient on unmount
      if (vc != null && playerUi != null) {
        vc.removeAllListeners("playerAdded");
        vc.removeAllListeners("playerRemoved");
        vc.dispose("Private Broadcaster component unmounting/re-render");
        playerUi.dispose();
        setPlayerUi(null);
        setVc(null);
        setPeer(null);
      }
    };
  }, [backendEndpoint, vc]);

  // useEffect that handles the instantiation of our encoderUi State.
  useEffect(() => {
    if (encoderUi == null) {
      (async () => {
        // Init our mediaController and then pass that as an option to our new EncoderUiState
        await mediaController.init();
        const mediaStreamController = await mediaController.requestController();
        setEncoderUi(new EncoderUiState(mediaStreamController));
      })();
    }
    return () => {
    // Ensure we are cleaning up the encoder on unmount.
      if (encoderUi != null) {
        encoderUi.dispose("Private Broadcaster component unmounting/re-render");
        setEncoderUi(null);
      }
    };
  }, [encoderUi]);

  return (
    <>
      {encoderUi != null && (
        <Encoder
          setOwnerCall={(call: types.BaseCall | null) => setOwnerCall(call)}
          encoderUi={encoderUi}
          videoclient={vc}
          callState={callState}
        />
      )}
        {playerUi != null ? (
          <button onClick={kickPeer} type="button">
            Kick Viewer
          </button>
          <Player playerUi={playerUi} />
        )}
    </>
  );
};


export default BroadcastOwner;
```

### Step 3: Ensure you properly adjust the scope of the token for the VideoClient

This has already been discussed in the code above but it is required to change the scope of your token to `private-broadcaster`. If the scope is not changed you will not be streaming able to achieve direct streaming.

Here is an example of the scope change in your token refresher:

```ts
tokenRefresher({
          backendEndpoint,
          authUrl: `${backendEndpoint}/apps/demos/api/demo/v1/access-token`,
          streamKey,
          scope: "private-broadcaster",
          clientReferrer,
        }),
```

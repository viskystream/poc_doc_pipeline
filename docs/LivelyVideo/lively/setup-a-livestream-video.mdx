## Setting up an Encoder

An Encoder is a video-client component for streaming audio and/or video by a broadcaster. The encoder converts your video/audio stream into a digital format understood by browsers and players (see more on Player) .

### 1. authToken

The authToken is what gives a user permission to connect.

**IMPORTANT**: To use an Encoder, you must have a subdomain which is provided by LivelyVideo.

### 2. Imports

You'll need to import these required components for Context:

1. **_EncoderUiState_** - A Class that manages the `mediaStreamController` and ui state for the Encoder.
2. **_VideoClientContext_** - This is a React Context instance that manages global state for your VideoClient instance.
3. **_EncoderUiContext_** - This is a React Context instance that manages global state for your Encoder Ui instance.
4. **_CallContext_** - This is a React Context instance that manges global state for your call instance.
5. **_CallState_** - This is used to create our CallState which is used to start, stop and join broadcasts.
6. **_VideoClient_** -- This is the VideoClient class.
7. **_mediaController_** -- This controls the MediaStream.
8. **_types_** -- For `VideoClient` types, if you are using TypeScript

```js
import {
  EncoderUiState,
  VideoClientContext,
  EncoderUiContext,
  CallContext,
  CallState,
  VideoClient,
  mediaController,
  types,
} from "@video/video-client-web";
```

You'll also need to import these components to be used for the Encoder.

```js
import {
  JoinBroadcastButton,
  CameraButton,
  ControlBar,
  EncoderAudioDeviceSelect,
  EncoderEchoCancellationCheckbox,
  EncoderNoiseSuppressionCheckbox,
  EncoderVideo,
  EncoderVideoDeviceSelect,
  FullscreenButton,
  MediaContainer,
  MicrophoneButton,
  SettingsButton,
  SettingsSidebar,
  TestMicButton,
} from "@video/video-client-web";
```

### 3. Required Properties

Before you are able to create an Encoder, there are a few required values you will need to have.

**_VideoClientOptions_**: Object

- **_backendEndpoints_**: string[] - This is an array of URLs we try when we are creating a call. If a URL fails to connect, this will failover to the next URL and so on.  
  **Note: A minimum of one URL is required.**

**_BroadcastOptions_**: Object

- **_streamName_**: string - Name of the stream (see more on streamName).

### 4. Setting up state

Once you have your imports and required properties, you are ready to create your state. For the Encoder, you will
need to setup a `vc`, `call` and a `encoderUi` to manage state.

The `vc` manages the `VideoClient` state, which is the Class that gives us access to create or join a call and manages peer state.

The `encoderUi` manages the UI state of the Encoder, including the `mediaController` (see more on mediaController).

The `callState` manages the state for your created `call`. Note that the call will not be defined here until a call has been started or joined.

```ts
const [vc, setVc] = useState<types.VideoClientAPI | null>(null);
const [encoderUi, setEncoderUi] = useState<EncoderUiState | null>(null);
const [callState, setCallState] = useState<CallState | null>(null);
```

### 5. Create your Video Client instance and CallState

`VideoClient` is a video-client class that connects to the server and enables either creating a call or joining
an existing call. A `VideoClient` instance is required for _each_ user.

`CallState` which will be used as the provider for our `CallContext` is used to start, stop and join active broadcasts. It is required for use with the joinBroadcast button but can also be helpful if you choose to create your own component.

When creating the useEffect for your `VideoClient` instance be sure to only include things in your dependency array that will allow for disposal and cleanup of the `VideoClient` instance to occur when the `VideoClient` instance has changed or is removed. Failure to do so may result in cleanup code running more often than desired.

**Be sure to **dispose** the `VideoClient` instance on unmount!**

```ts
import React, { useEffect } from "react";

useEffect(() => {
  if (vc == null) {
    const opts: types.VideoClientOptions = {
      backendEndpoints: ["https://yourEndpoint"], // If you do not have a LivelyVideo subdomain, contact LivelyVideo.
      token: tokenRefresher(tokenOptions),
      loggerConfig: {
        clientName: "LivelyVideo",
        writeLevel: "debug", // Defaults to debug, but can be info, warn, notice, deprecated, network, local, timing, or trace. Recommend leaving this as debug.
      },
    };
    setVc(new VideoClient(opts));
    setCallState(new CallState());
  }
  return () => {
    if (vc != null) {
      vc.dispose();
      setVc(null);
    }
  };
  /*
   * Remember to only include things in your dependency array that are related to the state of your `VideoClient` instance, otherwise disposal may occur at undesired times.
   */
}, [vc]);
```

For details on obtaining a token or implementing a tokenRefresher see [How do I create a authToken?](/docs/basic-operator-integration/methods-of-authorization/authentication-tokens/using-an-auth-token-in-the-browser)

### 6. Create the `mediaController` and set the `encoderUi` store.

A `mediaController` is a video client class which controls accessing audio and video streams from your browser. This
gets passed into the `EncoderUiState` constructor.

**Be sure to dispose of the `EncoderUi` instance on unmount!**

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  if (encoderUi == null) {
    (async () => {
      await mediaController.init();
      const mediaStreamController = await mediaController.requestController();
      setEncoderUi(new EncoderUiState(mediaStreamController));
    })();
  }

  return () => {
    if (encoderUi != null) {
      encoderUi.dispose();
      setEncoderUi(null);
    }
  };
}, [encoderUi]);
```

### 7. Render imported components.

Now that you have set up your state, you can construct your UI.

```js
<VideoClientContext.Provider value={vc}>
  <CallContext.Provider value={callState}>
    <EncoderUiContext.Provider value={encoderUi}>
      {encoderUi != null && (
        <MediaContainer>
          <EncoderVideo />
          <ControlBar>
            <CameraButton />
            <MicrophoneButton />
            // When the broadcast button is pressed on the UI, the id (UUID) //
            that was generated in the tokenRefresher method will be returned. //
            Video-Client players may use this id to join the stream.
            <JoinBroadcastButton
              setCallId={(id) => {}}
              broadcastOptions={{ streamName: "lively" }}
            />
            <ScreenCaptureButton />
            <FullscreenButton />
            <SettingsButton />
          </ControlBar>
          <SettingsSidebar>
            <EncoderVideoDeviceSelect />
            <EncoderAudioDeviceSelect />
            <EncoderResolutionSelect />
            <EncoderNoiseSuppressionCheckbox />
            <EncoderEchoCancellationCheckbox />
            <TestMicButton />
          </SettingsSidebar>
        </MediaContainer>
      )}
    </EncoderUiContext.Provider>
  </CallContext.Provider>
</VideoClientContext.Provider>
```

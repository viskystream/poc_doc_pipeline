There are two ways to create players: via `backendEndpoints`, and via a manifest.

## Setting up Players via backendEndpoints

### 1. Auth token

The token is what gives a user permission to connect.

**IMPORTANT**: To use a Player, you must have a subdomain.  You will get your subdomain from your Engagement Manager at {{COMPANY_NAME}}.  For details on obtaining a token or implementing a tokenRefresher see [How do I create a token?](/docs/basic-operator-integration/video-client#how-do-i-create-a-token)

### 2. imports

You'll need to import these required components:

1. **_CallContext_** - This is a Call Context instance that manages global call state for the Player instance.
2. **_PlayerUiContext_** - This is a Player UI Context instance that manages UI state for the Player instance.
3. **_PlayerUiState_** - A Class that manages the UI state for the Player.
4. **_VideoClient_** - This is the VideoClient class.
5. **_types_** -- For `VideoClient` types, if you are using TypeScript

```js
import {
  CallContext,
  PlayerUiContext,
  PlayerUiState,
  VideoClient,
  types,
} from "{{VIDEO_CLIENT_WEB_PACKAGE}}";
```

You'll also need to import these components to be used for the Player.

```js
import {
  ControlBar,
  MediaContainer,
  PlayerAudioButton,
  PlayerBitrateButton,
  PlayerFullscreenButton,
  PlayerGetSoundButton,
  PlayerOverlayButton,
  PlayerPlayButton,
  PlayerVideo,
  PlayerVolumeRange,
} from "{{VIDEO_CLIENT_WEB_PACKAGE}}";
```

### 3. Required Properties

Before you are able to create a Player you need three pieces of information. There are two objects that you will need to define - the _VideoClientOptions_ and the _CallOptions_. Please see the description below for additional information about these two objects.

**_VideoClientOptions_**: Object

- **_backendEndpoints_**: string[] - This is an array of URLs we try when we are creating a call. If a URL fails to connect, this will failover to the next URL and so on.
  **Note: A minimum of one URL is required.**

**_CallOptions_**: Object

- **_callId_**: string - This is the `callId` for the call.  It is associated with the broadcast and is a UUID, a unique value.
- **_userId_**: string - This is the `userId` that will be passed into the call.  It is an identifier for the user.  It is used by the {{COMPANY_NAME}} team for logging purposes.  In an application, it would normally be the display name of the user.  It is not required to be a unique value.

[The rest of the content remains unchanged, except for the following modifications:]

- Replace all instances of "@video/video-client-web" with "{{VIDEO_CLIENT_WEB_PACKAGE}}"
- Replace "https://yourEndpoint" and similar endpoint references with "{{YOUR_ENDPOINT}}"
- Replace "your-app-name" with "{{YOUR_APP_NAME}}"
- Replace " " and similar company references with "{{COMPANY_NAME}}"

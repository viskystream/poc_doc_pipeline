It may become necessary for you to blur the stream for a viewer. There are three use cases for you to consider doing this in your broadcasts and in your applications.

## Use Cases

### Viewers are Watching too Long

This case is manually controlled through props by blurring the video wrapper element after a specified time. The implementor would be responsible for creating this.

### Policy Violation

The system needs to be able to blur the stream in case the broadcaster is violating one of your policies.

### Unauthorized Viewer

If users have an invalid authToken for a private/paid stream, users will get a blurred stream with no audio.

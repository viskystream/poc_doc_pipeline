There are two types of interactions:

## Direct stream

A direct stream allows you to create a private stream between a broadcaster and an attendee. This is useful for creating premium experiences where a viewer in a large audience gets exclusive access through sharing their video with the broadcaster. For example, you can upgrade a viewer of a concert to superfan status, allowing the performing band to see and interact with individual viewers.

## Group call

Launch a secure video conference where multiple participants can socialize or collaborate. This is best used for remote gatherings of small and medium groups where low latency is important for real-time conversations and interactions. Host online lessons, daily standups, brainstorming sessions, virtual happy hours, and team-building activities.
